# minecraft-data-generator-server

This tool generates minecraft-data files based on a running server using a fabric mod.
The supported versions can be read in the directory structure.
Every version has its own directory.

## Usage

You can put any version that has a directory into the command below.
Just replace `<version>` with the version you want to generate.

For Linux/Mac OS:

```bash
./gradlew :<version>:runServer
```

For Windows:

```bash
gradlew.bat :<version>:runServer
```

You can then find the minecraft-data in the `<version>/run/minecraft-data` directory.

## Adding a new version

To add a new version, you need to create a new directory in the root directory with the version name.
Then you need to add the version to the list in the `settings.gradle.kts` file.
Then also add it to the `.github/workflows/build.yml` file.
Then copy the code of the most recently released version into the new directory.
Then you need to change the values in the `gradle.properties` file.
At last, you need to fix all code issues that are caused by the new version.
if there are any new curse, treasure, or non-tradeable, or non-discoverable enchantments in the new version, you need to add them manually to the `EnchantmentsDataGenerator` class.
For that, use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA to fix the issues.
Once everything compiles, you can commit the changes, push them to your fork and create a pull request.
Once your PR was accepted and merged, the new version will be available in the next release.
